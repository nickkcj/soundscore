## 🐳 Running with Docker

If you prefer not to install anything locally, you can spin up the app using Docker:

```bash
# Step 1: Build the image
docker-compose build

# Step 2: Run the containers
docker-compose up
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

> ℹ️ **Note**: This project uses a PostgreSQL database.  
> You must provide your own database credentials via a `.env` file.  
> Demo users (`demo1`, `demo2`, `demo3`) won't work unless you connect to the same database instance.  
> You can create your own account after setting up the app locally.

## 🧪 Local Setup (Optional)

If you're not using Docker, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/nickkcj/soundscore.git
cd soundscore

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add your environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root folder with:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

🛑 **Important**: You must provide your own PostgreSQL database or ask the maintainer for credentials.  
There is **no public demo DB** for security reasons.

```bash
# 5. Run migrations and start the server
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
